Some terminals don't support Shift-KeyPad
=========================================

Shift-keypad was chosen because primary development happened on a laptop
that didn't have page up/down keys. When Shift Up/down was mapped to
the previous/next files, it made more sense to support left/right for
outline files.

On terminal emulators without this support, while page up/down still
make sense, the home/end functionality does not.

If you really want it to make sense, use a terminal emulator with
shift-keypad functionality.


Backspace messes up the numbers
===============================

Backspace to remove the previous word is an experimental feature and
may be removed.

It is known to not always play nicely with contests.

It's an issue. I've stopped using the functionality, so it may be going
away.
